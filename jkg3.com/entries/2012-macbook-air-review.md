#title 2012 11" MacBook Air
#date 2012-03-14

I've had a 2012 model MacBook Air for about 6 weeks now. Overall, i'm pretty damn impressed. It's nearly perfect. 

I decided to consolidate onto the Air after trying out the 13" Retina Pro. The Pro showed that i could consolidate everything i do onto a single MacBook. Only, the 13" Retina pro was not the right MacBook. I preferred the 11" form factor more than i enjoyed the retina display. The lower cost was also a not inconsiderate bonus. 

I was at first sceptical about the 2012 model MacBook Air. I tried one when they were released and frankly, it sucked. It was hot, unreliable and crashy. Thankfully the issues have now all be sorted.

The Air wins for me in 3 areas. Size, performance and price.

#Size.
I have been carrying an 11" MacBook for years, they are incredibly portable. They are small enough to open fully on a train seat and light enough to carry everywhere. In the hand the 11" Air is easy to manipulate and move around. The 13" Pro is just a little to big and heavy for me to feel comfortable throwing around. 

The Air also work better on my lap when i am sat on the sofa chatting online while watching TV.

#Performance.
Since 2010 the performance profile for the Air has radically changed. In 2010 the Air was just about "fast enough" to be useful. I could use it for development but it lagged slightly behind other options. The 2Gb RAM limit also imposed a hard limit on what i could do. 

The 2012 Air is a completely different beast. The CPU performance is midrange and and the RAM limit has quadrupled. My new Air has 8Gb of RAM onboard. Plenty for my current needs and with enough headroom for my requirements to nearly double before an upgrade is required.

Another way of looking at the Air is purely with the numbers. On geekbench the Air scores around 5400 points, thats around 80% the performance of the Quad core iMac it replaces. Its pretty remarkable that a dual core ultraportable laptop can keep up with a quad core desktop with triple the power budget.

The Air is a pleasure to work on. Whereas the 13" Pro could be laggy in use the 11" Air is fluid and robust. Outside of the occasional scrolling blip in safari the performance of the Air has been rock solid and stable.

With the performance also comes resonably cool running. The enclosure bottom only registers 1 or 2 degrees warmer than the bottom of 2010 model. 

#Price
With a healthy education discount I paid around £900 for my 11" Air including the 8gb RAM upgrade and 3 years of warranty.  At the time, this compared very favourable with the 13" Pro. The Pro was closer to £1400 all in.

I could not justify the extra cost considering my dislike of the 13" form factor. It was a pretty close run thing in places, but overall i like the 11" size to much. All in from selling my iMac and my old MacBook Air i have more than covered the cost for the new Air with some money to return to my savings.
